## Project: Travelling Businessman

Travelling Businessman (TBM) is a desktop app for managing cross-border contacts, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TBM can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
