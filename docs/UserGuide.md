## Quickstart

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source:** Please refer to the [Introduction to UI](#appendix-a---introduction-to-the-ui) if you're trying **_TBM_** out for the first time.
</div>

Before you start using **_TBM_**, 

1. Ensure you have Java 11.

1. Download the application file (.jar file) from [here](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/releases).

1. Navigate to the directory that the application file was downloaded to. To start the application:

    1. Double click on the `TBM.jar` file and the application will start shortly.

    1. Alternatively, open any shell terminal in the current directory and run the command `java -jar TBM.jar`.

Now that you have started **_TBM_**,

1. Type any command in the command box and press Enter to execute it.

1. ***(Recommended for new users)*** The [`help`](#help-window) command will show a help page of some commonly
 used commands to fully utilise **_TBM_**.

   * **_Either_** press the **F1** key on your keyboard, **_or_** type the [`help`](#help-window) command in the command box and
    press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing [`help`](#help-window) and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

The following section outlines the commands supported by **_TBM_**. A short description is given for each command along with the format that they should be executed with. Complex commands also come with examples to demonstrate the purpose that the command serve.

Certain commands require parameters and the summary of these parameters as well as their prefixes and constraints can be found in our [parameters summary table](#parameter-constraints-summary). **Note that parameter prefixes such as `t/` and `nt/` are special keywords and you should not use them for any other purposes except for indicating the start of a parameter.**

A summary of all commands can be found in our [command summary table](#command-summary)
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `client add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `client add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [ce/CONTRACT_EXPIRY_DATE]` can be used as `n/John Doe ce/2-3-2020`(both supplied) or as `n/John Doe`(optional parameter missing).

* Items in round brackets mean that you have to supply at least one of them.<br>
  e.g. `INDEX (n/NAME) (n/PHONE_NUMBER)` can be used as `1 n/John Doe` or `1 p/98899889` or `1 n/John Doe p/98899889`, but not as `1` (i.e. both items are not supplied).

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

</div>

### Viewing help: `help`

Shows commonly used commands for **_TBM_** in a [new help window](#help-window). Pressing Esc will close this window.

Format: `help`

### Viewing all saved clients: `client list`

Shows a list of all clients in **_TBM_**. If a client's data fields are too long, they may be cut off in the client card, but you can view them in full using the [`client view`](#viewing-a-client--client-view) command.
This command will also reset the left display panel to its default view. 

Format: `client list`

### Adding a client: `client add`

Adds a new client to **_TBM_**.

Format: `client add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS c/COUNTRY_CODE tz/TIMEZONE [ce/CONTRACT_EXPIRY_DATE]`

Please refer to [Appendix B](#appendix-b-international-standards-followed) to understand the International Standards that **_TBM_** follows for phone numbers and country codes.
Example:

* Command: `client add n/Katya p/98123456 e/katya@yahoo.com a/Vladivostok, Nevelskogo, bld. 15, appt. 256 c/RU tz/GMT+3 ce/2-3-2020`<br>

  Adds a new client with name **Katya**, phone number **98123456**, email **katya@yahoo.com**, address **Vladivostok, Nevelskogo, bld. 15, appt. 256**, country **Russia**, timezone **GMT+3**, contract expiry date **2 Mar 2020**.

### Viewing a client: `client view`

Views the client specified by the `INDEX` parameter.
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source:** Please refer to [this](#ui-when-viewing-clients) if you need to be re-acquainted with the UI for client related commands
</div>

Format: `client view INDEX`

Example:

Given the current list of clients:
```
1. Katya
2. Alex
```
Command: `client view 2`

The information for the client at index 2 of the list will be shown. In the example above, Alex's information will be displayed.

### Finding clients: `client find`

Finds clients whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `client find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`.
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`.
* Only the name is searched.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Han` will not match `Hans`.
* Clients matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. `Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang`.

Examples:

* Command: `client find katya`

   Finds all clients with names that matches **katya**.

* Command: `client find Katya Hans`

   Finds all clients whose names contain either **Katya** or **Hans**.

### Editing a client: `client edit`

Edits a client's information by their index in the list view. Only edits the fields that have been passed in as parameters.

Format: `client edit INDEX (n/NAME) (p/PHONE) (e/EMAIL) (a/ADDRESS) (c/COUNTRY_CODE) (tz/TIMEZONE) (ce/CONTRACT_EXPIRY)`

Examples:

* Command: `client edit 5 n/Katya`

    Only edits **name** to `Katya`, other fields remain the same.

* Command: `client edit 4 n/Alek p/34842097 e/dcsdcr@nus.edu.sg`

    Edits **name** to `Alek`, **phone number** to `34842097` and **email** to `dcsdcr@nus.edu.sg`, other fields remain the same.

* Command: `client edit 1 c/JP tz/GMT+7`

    Edits **country** to `Japan` and **timezone** to `GMT+7`, other fields remain the same.

Given the client below:

```
Client 1
--------
Name: Alex
Phone: 911
Country: Singapore
Timezone: GMT+8
...(other fields omitted)
```
Command: `client edit 1 c/JP tz/GMT+7`

Alex's **country** and **timezone** will be edited, and the following will be the result.

```
Client 1
--------
Name: Alex
Phone: 911
Country: Japan
Timezone: GMT+7
...(other fields omitted)
```

### Deleting a client: `client delete`

Deletes a client by their index in the list view.

Format: `client delete INDEX`

Example:

* Command: `client delete 5`

    Deletes the client at index 5 of the list panel.

### Saving data

Your data is automatically saved after every command you enter. The file is saved in the ubiquitous `.json` format, which
allows you to edit the file manually without even opening **_TBM_** up.

The location for this file is `./data/tbmManager.json` (indicated at the bottom left of the application), where the
 `.` represents the directory where you have saved `TBM.jar`. Here's a snippet of this editable text file:

```json5
{
  "clients" : [ {
    "name" : "Alex Yeoh",
    "phone" : "87438807",
    "email" : "alexyeoh@example.com",
    "address" : "Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40",
    "country" : "SG",
    "timezone" : "GMT+8",
    "contractExpiryDate" : "21-4-2022",
    "lastModifiedInstant" : "2020-01-01T00:00:00Z",
    "clientNotes" : [ {
      "contents" : "Wants to take his wife to Norway for New Years' Day",
      "countryCode" : "NULL_CC",
      "tags" : [ "romantic", "holidayPlans", "travel" ]
    } ]
  } ]
  . . .
}
```

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source:** Tweaking this file should be done <strong><i>only</i></strong> if you're familiar with JSON
. If you're new to JSON, <a href="https://www.json.org/json-en.html">here's</a> a good place to learn more.
</div>

### Adding client notes: `client note add`

Adds a note to the client at the specified index in the list view. If a note with the exact same content and tags already exists, a "duplicate note" error will be displayed.

## Appendix A - Introduction to the UI

### Start Page

The diagram below shows the key UI elements of **_TBM_** upon first start-up.

  ![Annotated UI Default Page](images/command-screenshots/UI_annotated.png)
  <p align="center"><i>Figure 2. Default View</i></p>

* **Command Box** allows you to input commands to interact with **_TBM_**.

* **Client List Panel** will always allow you to view all your clients' information at a go. It's scrollable so that you 
never have to worry about not being able to see all your important clients at a single glance!

* **Client Card** will show you brief information about a particular client. 

* **Result Display** will show you the output of executing your command.
    * It indicates successful commands.
    
    * On the off-chance there's a syntax issue, **_TBM_** will remind you of the correct syntax it expects, something like this:
 
     ![Result Display showing error message](images/command-screenshots/result_display_error_syntax.png)
     <p align="center"><i>Figure 3. Error Display</i></p>
     
* **Display Panel** shall render *Client Cards* or *Country Cards* when relevant commands are sent. The default view shows you your local time to the precise second, as well as your current location.
   
### UI when Viewing Clients

The diagram below is what you should see upon viewing a particular client (i.e. firing up the command `client view 1
`). It shows how to identify a particular client's `CLIENT_INDEX`, and an associated note's `CLIENT_NOTE_INDEX`.

  ![Annotated Client View UI Layout](images/command-screenshots/client_view_annotated.png)
  <p align="center"><i>Figure 4. Client View</i></p>

Here, the **Client Note Card** displaying the note that's tagged as `hobbies` is referred to by the `CLIENT_INDEX` of `1`.

Being able to identify these is key to adding, deleting and editing client notes as well as editing clients.

### UI when Viewing Country

Similarly, `COUNTRY_NOTE_INDEX` can be identified like so by referring to the index indicated on the **Country Note Card**:

  ![Annotated Country Note View UI Layout](images/command-screenshots/country_note_view_annotated.png)
  <p align="center"><i>Figure 5. Country Note View</i></p>

### Help Window

This is what to expect when you type in the `help` command or press `F1`: 

  ![help window](./images/command-screenshots/help_window.png)
  <p align="center"><i>Figure 6. Help Window</i></p>

## Appendix B: International Standards Followed 

### ISO Country Codes

**_TBM_** utilizes 2-letter country codes that follow the **_ISO3166_** specification. This [finding tool](https://www.countrycode.org/) can be used.

### Phone Numbers

**_TBM_**'s format for phone numbers is **_based_** on the [E.164 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E.164) as recommended by the _ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T)_.
**_However_**, **_TBM_** doesn't allow for spaces in between phone number fields. For example, `+65 8186 7742` may follow this international standard, but **_TBM_ requires you to remove spacing within the phone number field** so the correct way to input it would be `+65 81867742`. 

Here are the alternative stylistic choices that you might make when writing out phone numbers, all of which are valid:
* Phone numbers can be grouped into `COUNTRY_CODE` and `NATIONAL_PHONE_NUMBER`. We shall refer to `NATIONAL_PHONE_NUMBER` simply as **_phone number field_** in this appendix.
    * Please note that the **_phone number field_** may only have a **maximum of 12 digits**, all without spaces. The digit count restriction is as per the "global services specification" of **E.164**.
    * `COUNTRY_CODE` field is optional and may be omitted by you. 
      * Adding country codes for the telephone numbers:
        * Country code numbers range from 1 to 3 digits and may be found from this [finding tool](https://www.countrycode.org/). You **must** prepend the country code with a `+` character.  
          * `+6581867742` is a valid phone number where `+65` is the country code for Singapore.
        * **If you wish to, you may also separate country code and phone number fields with a delimiter:** Valid delimiters include: the " " character, "-", and "."
          * `+65 81867742` with a " " character is also a valid phone number. 
          * `+65-81867742` with a "-" character is also a valid phone number.
          * `+65.81867742` with a "." character is also a valid phone number.
            
         These options have been provided because we know that such delimiting is a matter of _cultural preference_.
